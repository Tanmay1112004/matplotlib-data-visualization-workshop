# 📊 Visualizing Data with Matplotlib

This repository contains projects and examples from a workshop on **Visualizing Data with Matplotlib**, conducted by **Kodi Prakash Senapati Sir**.

## 🎯 Workshop Overview

Data visualization helps represent data in a graphical format to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. It plays a vital role in fields like:

- 📈 Stock Market Analysis  
- 🏏 IPL Match Statistics  
- 🏥 Medical Explanations through Graphs

In this workshop, we explored how to create various types of visualizations using **Matplotlib**, a popular Python library for plotting.

## 👥 Target Audience

This workshop is ideal for:
- Business Analysts  
- Data Analysts  
- Aspiring Data Scientists  

## 💼 Business Use Case

Small businesses often rely on expensive BI tools to visualize data and discover insights. With **Matplotlib**, we can build similar visualizations using just Python.

> 💡 Matplotlib combines **math**, **graphics**, and **linear algebra** to produce powerful visual plots.

## 📊 Graphs Created

During the session, I created the following types of graphs:

1. **Line Plot**
2. **Stacked Bar Chart**
3. **Pie Chart**
4. **Scatter Plot**
5. **Histogram**
6. **Box Plot**
